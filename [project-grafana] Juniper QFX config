 In regards to gRPC telemetry connections. 
 We have a Grafana box using telegraf to connect to our routers and pull telemetry data (bandwidth / cpu / ect) via gRPC.  
 Telegraf is using a user/pass that is locally configured on the juniper and using open-config for all strings.
 I'm reading over this Junos Telemetry Interface User Guide and trying to figure out what type of profile should be configured on the juniper.
